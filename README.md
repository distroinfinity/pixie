# Pixie

## The problem it solves

The problem that Pixie addresses and solves is how files and media are currently shared and consumed in Web3. The most ideal and natural thing that comes to our mind when we talk about storing and retrieving files is to store your files over IPFS and use the public hash to access them, and anybody that has the file hash can access them. This is fine and serves its purpose, but what if we want to restrict file access based on certain conditions or parameters, or better yet, manage or monetise access to an IPFS-stored file or media?
